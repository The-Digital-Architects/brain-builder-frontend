# \*\*\*Just an Experiment\*\*\*

This probably would not be easy to set up at all but I was wondering if we can make our slug radically lose weight by splitting the app into two - one for frontend and one for backend. Works in theory but we currently use Django to serve the frontend build so we'd have to do some redesigning there and I don't have that kind of time rn

So just gonna leave this here if we ever wanna come back to the idea
